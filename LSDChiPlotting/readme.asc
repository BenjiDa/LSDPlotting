Chi plotting tools
============================

These plotting tools are intended for use with the http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013JF002981/abstract[Mudd et al (2014)] code for analysis of channel profiles.

For the new raster plotter (*new_raster_plotter.py*), 
you will need to clone the mapping tools from this repository:
https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools/tree/master/LSDPlottingTools

The folder *LSDPlottingTools* must then be placed in the same directory as the `new_raster_plotter.py`.
